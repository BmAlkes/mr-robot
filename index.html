                    Eliot (Rami Malek) is a young security engineer who suffers from social phobia. He works as a computer security technician during the day, and as a watchful hacker at night. Elliot finds himself at a crossroads when the leader of a mysterious group of hackers, called Fsociety, recruits him to destroy a company he believes is controlling - and destroying - the world.
                    
                    Motivated by his personal beliefs, Elliot Alderson fights the company while pretending to protect it.</p>
